# HapFunc
Haplotype resolve epigenetic and transcriptomic data types

HapFunc is used to haplotpye resolve epigentic and transcriptomic datasets based on haplotpye specific assemblies. Each code is tailored to features of the underlying dataset. Resolution can be done on paired-end illumina sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq), paired-end illumina sequencing which is mapped as single-ended reads (e.g. Hi-C) or long reads (e.g. iso-seq).

In order to run this code you need a SNP file for haplotype A and haplotype B.
